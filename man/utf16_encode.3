.SH DESCRIPTION
Encodes the Unicode scalar value \f[I]c\f[R] as UTF-16 code unit(s) and writes them to \f[I]buf\f[R].
The length of \f[I]buf\f[R] must be at least two code units.
.PP
If \f[I]c\f[R] is not a valid Unicode scalar value, \f[I]buf\f[R] remains unchanged and a negative integer is returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of code units written to \f[I]buf\f[R] on success.
Returns a negative integer if \f[I]c\f[R] is not a valid Unicode scalar value.
