.SH NAME
utf32le_decode \- decode UTF-32 (little endian)
.SH LIBRARY
Character decoder library (libcharisma, -lcharisma)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <charisma.h>
.PP
.BI "int32_t utf32le_decode(const uint32_t *" text ", int32_t " length ", int32_t *" index ", uchar *" c ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Decodes the Unicode scalar value from the UTF-32 encoded \f[I]text\f[R] at code unit \f[I]index\f[R] and writes it to \f[I]c\f[R].
The number of code units in \f[I]text\f[R] is specified by \f[I]length\f[R], which, if negative, indicates that \f[I]text\f[R] is null-terminated.
The implementation updates \f[I]index\f[R] to the code unit index of the next Unicode scalar value.
.PP
If the character at code unit \f[I]index\f[R] is malformed, the Unicode Replacement Character (\f[C]U+FFFD\f[R]) is written to \f[I]c\f[R], and the implementation safely advances beyond it.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a positive integer when a well-formed Unicode character is decoded, writing the decoded scalar value to \f[I]c\f[R].
Returns a negative integer when a malformed character is encountered, writing the Unicode Replacement Character (\f[C]U+FFFD\f[R]) to \f[I]c\f[R].
Returns zero when the end of \f[I]text\f[R] is reached, writing NUL (\f[C]U+0000\f[R]) to \f[I]c\f[R].
