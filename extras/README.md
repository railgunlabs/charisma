# Charisma Command-Line Interface

This directory contains the source code for the Charisma command-line interface (CLI).
The Charisma CLI lets you convert between Unicode character encoding forms, optionally repairing malformed character sequences.

The Charisma CLI is an extra add-on, separate from the Charisma library, and does **not** attempt to be MISRA compliant.
It also requires a POSIX-compliant environment.
